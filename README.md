# Mine-Field-Alarm-Android

This project started as an idea of Organisation of Amputees UDAS of Republic of Srpska. 

Since Bosnia and Herzegovina has a problem with mine pollution, UDAS decided to develop an application that will trigger an alarm on the
android device when carrier comes near the minefield.

As an volounteer in organisation UDAS, I began implementing this application as an University project.

Because I don't have much time to develop whole application myself, and since that this application can be useful 
in any other country or area that has the same problem as Bosnia I decided to make this project an open source so I 
am calling any java / android programmer, UI designer or anyone with any good idea for improvement and application 
develompent to participate and contribute in one good and human idea - to possibly save a life.
