# Mine-Field-Alarm-Android

This project started as an idea of "Organisation of Amputees UDAS Republike Srpske". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Organization_of_Amputees_UDAS_Republike_Srpske) 

Since Bosnia and Herzegovina has a problem with mine pollution, UDAS decided to develop an application that will trigger an alarm on the
android device when carrier comes near the minefield.

There are still around 12 000 minefields in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are more than 1500 post-war victims of landmines in Bosnia.

The database with coordinates of existing minefields currently exist handwritten on papers.

As an volounteer in organisation UDAS, I began implementing this application as an University project.

Because I don't have much time to develop whole application myself, and since that this application can be useful 
in any other country or area that has the same problem as Bosnia I decided to make this project an open source so I 
am calling any java / android programmer, UI designer or anyone with any good idea for improvement and application 
develompent to participate and contribute in one good and human idea - to possibly save a life.

Also, I found some bugs in my code, and I even forgot what they are - so it would be good to report them asap.
Some optimisations and refactoring could be made. Documentation also needs improvement.

At this stage app has connection with google geolocation API and google maps API. It also can draw radius on map that will represent a minefield. It already triggers an alarm but it is buggy.
