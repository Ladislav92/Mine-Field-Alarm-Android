# Welcome and thank you !!!

Minefield alarm is pretty new project. As I am new to open source and working on project with more people ANY help
or suggestion would be nice. As the time passes I will try to upgrade this file and make it more and more detail.

# What should I know before I get started?

Our [discord](https://discord.gg/b4EDUDs) server.

Right now, project has only few classes and it is small. There are some bugs, some things to be upgraded and many to be changed.
You could check what is developed already and what could you develop in [issues](https://github.com/Ladislav92/Mine-Field-Alarm-Android/issues) and [readme](https://github.com/Ladislav92/Mine-Field-Alarm-Android/blob/master/README.md) file.

# How can I help ?

## Help organising this repository !
Many of (for now) few people that are willing to work on this project don't have much experience in group projects or open source.
Change suggestions for README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are more than welcome.

## Report bugs !
If you find bug please try to report it. Provide as much details as possible (including stack trace, line where crushed). 
Also, see if you can reproduce it, ocassions in which it happens !

## Help with documentation !
Right now, documentation for this project is really poor and it needs improvements so it could be more useful to someone new.

## Suggest enhancements and new features!
You can create an issue with enhancement label where you can describe the idea for some improvement or whole new feature,
so we can talk about it and decide where to go.

## Getting your hands dirty !

I guess, this is why anyone actually came here. To start implementing stuff clone or fork the project and start working on
some issue you find interesting. When you finish create [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) , describe it so we can discuss it.

### Write javadocs for your methods.
When writing a comments, try to avoid inline comments, because they (usually) make pollution in the code.
External comments in form of javadoc commments are better idea. Try to document your code well. If you used stackoverflow solution provide link for it !

### It would be nice to write unit tests too.

## If yu are going to work on some issue, be sure to write comment on it so other people know ! ! !
